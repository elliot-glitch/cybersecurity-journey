The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a widely adopted set of guidelines
best practices, and standards designed to help organizations manage and 
reduce cybersecurity risks. Developed by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), the framework provides a flexible and voluntary
approach to improving cybersecurity posture across industries.


Key Components of the NIST CSF
The framework is structured around three main parts:

FRAMEWORK CORE

A set of cybersecurity activities, outcomes, and references organized into five functions:
Identify: Understand and manage cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
Protect: Implement safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services.
Detect: Develop capabilities to identify cybersecurity events.
Respond: Take action regarding detected cybersecurity incidents.
Recover: Restore capabilities or services impaired by cybersecurity incidents.
Each function is further divided into categories and subcategories, providing actionable steps.
Framework Implementation Tiers

Describes the maturity of an organization's cybersecurity risk management practices:
Tier 1 (Partial): Ad-hoc and reactive.
Tier 2 (Risk-Informed): Risk management practices are approved but not standardized.
Tier 3 (Repeatable): Formalized and consistently applied.
Tier 4 (Adaptive): Proactive and continuously improved.
Framework Profiles

Customized to align with an organization's business needs, risk tolerance,
and resources. Profiles help organizations compare their current 
cybersecurity posture with their target state.

PURPOSE AND BENEFITS 

Risk Management: Helps organizations prioritize and mitigate cybersecurity risks.
Compliance: Aligns with other standards like ISO 27001, CIS Controls, and regulatory requirements.
Communication: Provides a common language for discussing cybersecurity risks and strategies.
Flexibility: Adaptable to any industry or organization size.
Who Uses the NIST CSF?
Private Sector: Businesses of all sizes use the framework to improve cybersecurity.
Government Agencies: Federal, state, and local governments adopt the framework for critical infrastructure protection.
International Organizations: The framework is recognized and adopted globally.
