#THE CAI TRIAD (CONFIDENTIALITY, INTERGRITY,AVAILABILITY)
The CAI is an abbreviation for data sensitivity in cybersecurity 

#C - CONFIDENTIALITY:This ensures that sensitive data is not accesed by
unauthorized users

✅ Real-world Examples:
Using passwords to access your email
Encrypting files so hackers can’t read them
Using VPNs to hide data from attackers

#I -INTERGRITY: It ensures the accuracy of data,and unmodified data
✅ Real-world Examples:
A bank transaction must not be altered in transit
A file downloaded must not be corrupted

#A - AVAILABILITY:Ensuring that data is available when needed;
without interruption
✅ Real-world Examples:
You can access your cloud files anytime
Websites stay online during peak hours

#WHY IT MATTERS 
The CIA Triad helps cybersecurity professionals evalutale risk and design 
security measures
A secure system must address all three elements
Focusing on one (like confidentaility) while ignoring another
(like availabilty) leads to weakness
