#‚úÖ 1.1 What Is a Network?
A network is a group of devices (computers, phones, servers, printers) connected together to share data and resources.
LAN (Local Area Network) ‚Äì Small area (e.g., home, office)
WAN (Wide Area Network) ‚Äì Large area (e.g., the internet)
VPN (Virtual Private Network) ‚Äì Secure connection through a public network

#AN IP ADDRESS
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique identifier for a device on a network. 
It lets devices send and receive data ‚Äî just like how a mailing address allows the post office to deliver letters

üîπ Two Versions of IP Addresses
1. IPv4 (Most common)
Format: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
Each ‚Äúxxx‚Äù is a number from 0‚Äì255
Total: ~4.3 billion possible addresses
Example: 172.217.14.206 ‚Üí a Google server


#IPv6 (Next-gen, more addresses)
Format: hexadecimal, separated by :
e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Supports 340 undecillion addresses (massive)
Slowly replacing IPv4 due to address exhaustion



üî∏ Subnetting (Intro)
A subnet divides a large network into smaller ones.
IP address: 192.168.1.100
Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 (or /24)
That means all IPs from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are on the same network


#Networking Security Fundamentals
The OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnetion Model) is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe how data moves through a network, from one device to another.
It breaks networking into 7 layers, each with a specific role. This makes it easier to troubleshoot, secure, and design networks.
# üß† OSI Model Cheat Sheet

The **OSI Model** (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into **7 layers**.

## üìö The 7 Layers of the OSI Model (Top to Bottom)

| Layer | Name         | Description & Example Protocols                      |
|-------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 7     | Application  | Interfaces directly with the user (e.g., HTTP, FTP) |
| 6     | Presentation | Formats data, encryption/decryption (e.g., SSL, JPEG) |
| 5     | Session      | Maintains connections (e.g., NetBIOS, PPTP)          |
| 4     | Transport    | Reliable delivery, error checking (e.g., TCP, UDP)   |
| 3     | Network      | Routing and addressing (e.g., IP, ICMP)              |
| 2     | Data Link    | MAC addressing, frame delivery (e.g., Ethernet, ARP) |
| 1     | Physical     | Transmission of raw bits (e.g., cables, NICs)        |

## üîê Why It Matters in Cybersecurity

- Helps pinpoint where network attacks happen (e.g., Layer 2 for ARP spoofing, Layer 7 for XSS)
- Supports structured security design
- Essential for working with tools like Wireshark, firewalls, ID

#HERE IS A REAL LIFE SENERIO ON HOW THE OSI MODEL WORKS 
You open your browser and type the query into Google. Behind the scenes, this is how it flows through the OSI Model:
                                                                        
Layer7 ‚Äì Application | Your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to Google‚Äôs server.                                        
Layer5 ‚Äì Session     | A secure session is established with Google‚Äôs server (e.g., via SSL/TLS handshake).                                 
Layer4 ‚Äì Transport   | The data is broken into **TCP segments**, ensuring it will arrive reliably.                                         
Layer3 ‚Äì Network**   | The segments are assigned source and destination **IP addresses** (yours and Google‚Äôs).                     
Layer2 ‚Äì Data Link** | Your computer‚Äôs **MAC address** is used to send the data across your local network to the router.              
Layer1 ‚Äì Physical**  | The data is converted to **electrical signals** (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) and sent physically across cables or wirelessly.
üîÅ Then the response (Google search results) comes back through the same layers in reverse, ending with your browser rendering the page.
