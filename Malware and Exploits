Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to any software intentionally designed
to cause damage, disrupt operations, steal data, or gain unauthorized access to 
systems or networks. It is a broad term encompassing various types of harmful programs
. Here are some common categories of malware:

Viruses: Attach themselves to clean files and spread to other files, often corrupting or deleting data.
Worms: Self-replicating malware that spreads across networks without user interaction.
Trojans: Disguised as legitimate software, they trick users into executing them to perform malicious actions.
Ransomware: Encrypts files or systems, demanding payment (ransom) for decryption.
Spyware: Secretly monitors user activity and collects sensitive information.
Adware: Displays unwanted advertisements, often bundled with free software.
Rootkits: Grants attackers privileged access while hiding their presence.
Keyloggers: Records keystrokes to steal passwords or other sensitive data.
Botnets: Networks of infected devices controlled remotely for malicious purposes (e.g., DDoS attacks).
How Malware Spreads:
Phishing Emails: Malicious attachments or links.
Drive-by Downloads: Automatically downloaded when visiting compromised websites.
Removable Media: USB drives or other external devices.
Software Vulnerabilities: Exploiting unpatched flaws in software or operating systems.
